I am a web developer in training with a background in newswriting. I studied journalism at Fresno State and wrote for the school paper there. After graduation, I spent some time as a general assignment reporter for the Sierra Star newspaper, which covered a number of small towns in eastern Madera County. I hope to one day return to the news industry , but this time as a web developer.
