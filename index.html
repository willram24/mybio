  <p>I am a web developer in training with a background in newswriting. I studied journalism at Fresno State. After
    graduation, I spent some time as a general assignment reporter for the Sierra Star newspaper, which covered a number
    of
    small towns in Eastern Madera County. I hope to one day return to the news industry, but this time as a web
    developer.</p>
